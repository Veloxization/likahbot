## What is LikahBot?
LikahBot is an open source general purpose Discord bot utilising the Pycord library. It's a project I originally started when I had minimal knowledge about programming practices. This repository is the complete rewrite of that original project.
## How do I use the bot?
At this moment, you don't. Currently this repository contains only base functionality. No actual bot that does anything is launched.

After the initial development steps are done, you have to create a bot user yourself and self-host it. There are many tutorials online if you search for them. My own instance of the bot is running on a server with limited capabilities which is enough for no more than a few smaller servers and I do not have the finances to fund a server with enough capability for an upscaled bot.
