## What is LikahBot?
LikahBot is an open source general purpose Discord bot utilising the Pycord library. It's a project I originally started when I had minimal knowledge about programming practices. This repository is the complete rewrite of that original project.
## How do I use the bot?
You have to create a bot user yourself and self-host it. There are many tutorials online if you search for them. My own instance of the bot is running on a server with limited capabilities which is enough for no more than a few smaller servers and I do not have the finances to fund a server with enough capability for an upscaled bot.
